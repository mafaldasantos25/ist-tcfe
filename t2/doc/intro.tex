% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study an RC circuit containing a sinusoidal voltage source $v_s(t)$, a dependent voltage source $V_d$ and a dependent current source $I_b$, as well as a capacitor $C$ connected to 7 resistors. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuito_t2}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
