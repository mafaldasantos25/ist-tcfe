\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have successfully analysed theoretically the given circuit, through the nodal method and the mesh method, using the Octave maths tool. By comparing with the results obtained with the simulation done with the Ngspice tool, we could see they were identical, which allowed us to confirm the validity of the methods and their perfect precision in simple circuits like the one given.
