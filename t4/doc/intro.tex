% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to develop an audio amplifier circuit with two separate stages: a gain stage and an output stage.

The circuit is composed of a voltage source and a resistor connected to an input coupling capacitor. Additionally, theres a bias circuit made of two resistors. In the gain stage we have a transistor and two resistors. There is also a bypass capacitor. The chosen architecture of the output stage is a transistor and a resistor. Finally, theres an output coupling capacitor and another resistor.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:circuito_t4}  is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
