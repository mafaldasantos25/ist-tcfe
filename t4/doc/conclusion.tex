\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating an audio amplifier circuit was achieved. By comparing the theoretical and simulated results we could see that there was a significant error caused by the approximations made for the theoretical transistor model and by not considering the capacitors in the theoretical analysis.
The total cost of the circuit is 1781.508 MU and the merit is 161.535. Both of these values were significantly improved by changing the capacitance of the coupling capacitors and of the bypass capacitor, to improve the bandwidth value.
