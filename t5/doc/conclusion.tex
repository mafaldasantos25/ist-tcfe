\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating a BandPass Filter was achieved. By comparing the theoretical and simulated results we could see that there wasn't a significant error.
The total cost of the circuit is 13637.66 MU and the merit is 8.391028e-07.
