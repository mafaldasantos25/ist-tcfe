\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating an AC/DC converter circuit was achieved. By comparing the theoretical and simulated results we could see that there was a significant error caused by the approximations made for the theoretical diode model.
The total cost of the circuit is 29.8 MU and the merit is 3.754540e-01.
