% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to dimension and implement a BandPass Filter (BPF) with a central frequency of 1kHz and a gain at central frequency of 40dB.

The circuit is as shown below in Figure \ref{fig:circuito_t5}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
